## Synopsis

A simple REST API using Hapi/TypeScript to drive a TODO backend app.

## Usage

```
$ yarn # To install packages (or npm install) as well as typings
$ yarn dev # To compile the TypeScript to JS and launch the dev server (or npm run dev)
$ yarn test # To compile the TypeScript to JS and run the Mocha/Chai tests
```

## TODOs

* Add persistence layer using Postgres/SQLite (and Docker-ize me).
* Add configurability through environment-based configurations.
* Add authorization/authentication using JWT and other tools I haven't decided on yet.
* Stricter TSLint rules.
